## Plex Client/Server Updates to Discord
I reworked the script so it's all in one. It has also been updated to work on the new Discourse Plex Forums. The first run will now cache the last post and no notification will be sent.

The new script only works with discord. I removed slack compatibility.

use python 3.6+
